### 🧠 Background

I am trained in both molecular biology and computational biology, combining wet-lab expertise with advanced data analytics.  
My work integrates *multi-omics*, *AI-based prediction*, and *spatial transcriptomics* to better understand tumor microenvironments and therapy responses.

### 🎓 Education
- **M.Sc. Biomedical Informatics**, *UT Health Houston*, 2024  
- **Ph.D. Lab Medicine & Pathology**, *University of Alberta*, 2019  
- **B.Sc. (Hon.) Biochemistry**, *University of British Columbia*, 2013  

### ⚙️ Core Skills
- NGS data analysis (bulk, scRNA-seq, spatial omics)  
- Pathway and immune deconvolution analyses  
- Gene signature development and survival analytics  
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), R (tidyverse, BiocManager)  
- Linux for large-scale data processing  
- Data visualization and report automation  

### 📜 Patent
**Pyroptosis-Associated Gene Signature (CASCADE)** for predicting treatment response in bladder cancer  
*(Houston Methodist Research Institute DISC2025014)*
