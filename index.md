# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Iâ€™m **Yung Hsing (Winston) Huang**, a **Bioinformatics and Cancer Research Expert** with 8+ years of academic and industrial experience in translational oncology, spatial omics, and molecular biology.

Currently, I serve as a **Bioinformatician** at the *Spatial Omics Core* of **Houston Methodist Research Institute**, supporting projects in **bulk RNA**, **single-cell RNA-seq**, **spatial transcriptomics (10x Xenium)**, and **spatial proteomics (Akoya Phenocycler)**.

This portfolio highlights my research, computational tools, and publications bridging *molecular biology* and *bioinformatics* for precision oncology.
