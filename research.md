### 🧬 Current Research — Houston Methodist Research Institute

**Spatial Omics Core & Keith Syson Chan Lab**  
I support translational bladder-cancer projects through spatial omics and bioinformatics, including:

- CAF heterogeneity in non-muscle- and muscle-invasive bladder cancer *(Gao et al., Science Advances 2025)*  
- Myelopoiesis skewing after chemotherapy and its effect on tumor microenvironment *(Wong et al., Nat Commun under revision)*  
- Matrix-induced stress responses via intratumoral collagens  
- Neutrophil heterogeneity and immune checkpoint therapy response  
- Diet-induced obesity effects on T-cell immunity in bladder cancer  
- Endothelial cell-mediated immune regulation in TME  
- Thrombosis in kidney clear cell carcinoma (collab with Dr. Dharam Kaushik)  
- Radiation vaccination clinical trial (collab with Dr. Raj Satkunasivam)

### 🧫 Prior Work — Systemic Bio (3D Systems)
Developed organ-/tumor-on-chip models for preclinical drug screening:  
assay development, hydrogel printing, ELISA, histology, data pipeline automation.

### 🧩 Postdoctoral Research — Houston Methodist Research Institute
- Identified **NHE6** as a therapeutic target in multiple myeloma.  
- Discovered **RARγ/IFN-β** pathways driving carfilzomib resistance.  
- Supported CPRIT grant *“Targeting NHE6 to improve clinical efficacy of daratumumab in myeloma” (RP220639).*
